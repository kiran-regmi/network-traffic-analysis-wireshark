# Network Traffic Analysis
**In this project,** we demonstrates basic network traffic analysis using Wireshark. It includes:
* Identifying common protocols
* Detecting suspicious patterns, and
* Applying filtering techniques to analyze pcap files.

**The goal** is to simulate a network analyst‚Äôs initial triage process and showcase familiarity with packet inspection, TCP/IP stack, and protocol behavior

### Tools Used
* Wireshark
* Sample PCAPs
* Protocol: TCP, DNS, HTTP, ICMP

### Step 1 - Install Wireshark
Free, open-source tool to capture and analyze packets
https://www.wireshark.org/

### Step 2 - Download or Capture Network Traffic
* Canputure your own using browser or local app
* Download PCAP files from:
  * https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/
  * https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures

**File Used: 2025-06-21 -- Koi Loader/Koi Stealer infection** 
 
 
### Step 3 - Apply Filters in Wireshark
* create a text file named " filters-used.txt

### Step 4 - Create Screenshots
* TCP 3-way handshakes
* DNS query/response
* Suspicious HTTP traffic
* Malformed packets

### Step 5 - Analysis Report
