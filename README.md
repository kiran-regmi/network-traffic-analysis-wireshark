# Network Traffic Analysis
**In this project,** we demonstrates basic network traffic analysis using Wireshark. It includes:
* Identifying common protocols
* Detecting suspicious patterns, and
* Applying filtering techniques to analyze pcap files.

**The goal** is to simulate a network analyst‚Äôs initial triage process and showcase familiarity with packet inspection, TCP/IP stack, and protocol behavior
